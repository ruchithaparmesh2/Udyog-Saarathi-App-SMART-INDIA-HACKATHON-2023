As a team, in the Smart India Hackathon 2023(SIH) , under the Ministry of Social 
Justice and Empowerment, we developed Udyog Saarthi, a React-based web application. It serves 
as a job portal specifically tailored for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), offering streamlined 
access to employment opportunities. With customizable filters based on the type of disability, the 
platform enhances inclusivity and accessibility, empowering PWDs to navigate the job market with 
ease and efficiency.
